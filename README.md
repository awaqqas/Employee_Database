# Employee_Database

**Purpose**

The purpose of this analysis was to prepare Bob's manager for the incoming 'silver tsunami' as many current employees are reaching retirement age. In this analysis we determined the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. To achieve this goal, only employees who were born between 1952 and 1955 and did not leave the company already were selected for the analysis. As a result, a final table was created with the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job titles. Lastly, a separate list of employees born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965 was created to examine which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

**Results**

- This table provides a list of the employee names and titles that are about to retire. To further understand which roles are being impacted by the retiring employees, we did a count analysis to decipher which role is being impacted the most.

- From the above image it can be seen that the senior engineer position is getting impacted the most, with 25,916 employees about to leave their post due to upcoming retirement. In contrast, the least amount of impact is seen for the manager position, with only 2 employees leaving the post. As such, Bobby's manager either has to promote from within the company to fill the senior engineer role or hire from external sources.

- This table provides a list of employees who meet the eligibility criteria for the mentorship program. As mentioned these are the employees who have not yet left the company and have birthdates falling between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

- To further understand how many employees were eligible to join the mentorship program, an additional query was added to count the employees based off their employee number. From the above image, it can be deduced that approximately 569 employees from the senior staff are eligible for the mentorship program, whereas only 77 are eligible from the technique leader role. 

**Summary**

Overall, Bobby's manager will have to prepare to fill the senior engineer positions at the company as majoirty of the employees retiring are from this speciality. In total,  72, 458 positions would need to be filled when employees start to retire.

Additionally, one can further analyze the dataset and extrapolate if the number of employees from the mentorship program will be enough to replace the number of empoyees retiring.

As it turns out, only 1,549 employees are available to replace the 72, 458 employees that will be potentially retiring from the company. This means that Bobby's manager would need to hire extensively to recover from the 'silver tsunami'.
